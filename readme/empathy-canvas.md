# Empathy Canvas

## What is Empathy Canvas?

The **Empathy Canvas** is a **structured reflection tool** that helps students deeply engage with the **lives of RealLives characters**, fostering empathy, perspective-taking, and emotional intelligence.

After living through a simulated life in **RealLives**, students use the **Empathy Canvas** to break down their experiences, analyze different aspects of the character’s journey, and compare them with their own lives.

It transforms **gameplay into a meaningful learning experience**, helping students develop **social-emotional skills, global awareness, and a changemaker mindset**.

## How Does Empathy Canvas Work?

### 📌 **Step-by-Step Reflection Framework**

The **Empathy Canvas** consists of structured **prompts and guiding questions** that encourage students to reflect on different aspects of a character’s life:

1️⃣ **Who Was Your Character?**

* Name, country, socio-economic background, gender, culture, and key life circumstances.
* "What was unique about their identity?"

2️⃣ **Key Moments & Turning Points**

* Major life events that shaped their journey (e.g., education, migration, war, economic hardship).
* "What was the most defining moment in their life?"

3️⃣ **Challenges & Struggles**

* Barriers faced (poverty, discrimination, health issues, gender inequality, etc.).
* "What were the toughest moments they had to overcome?"

4️⃣ **Decisions & Consequences**

* Important choices made and their long-term effects.
* "What difficult decisions did they face? What were the outcomes?"

5️⃣ **Compare & Contrast**

* How does this life compare to the student’s own life?
* "What privileges or challenges do you have that your character didn’t?"

6️⃣ **Feelings & Reflections**

* Emotional connection to the character’s story.
* "What emotions did you experience while living this life?"

7️⃣ **Real-World Connections & Actions**

* How does this experience relate to global issues?

## Empathy in Action: Real-World Examples

### **Example 1: Living as a Child in Extreme Poverty**

* **Reflect on systemic poverty** and how it affects opportunities.
* **Compare it to their own life**, realizing the role of privilege.
* **Explore solutions**, researching real-world efforts to combat extreme poverty (SDG 1).

### **Example 2: Experiencing Gender Discrimination**
